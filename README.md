### Areas of Interest
I am commited to transforming Los Angeles into a more equitable and inclusive region. We face many challenges in managing the complexities of our built environment, and there is still a long way to go to transform the quality of life of the most vulnerable residents. I'm interested in topics of environmental justice, climate resilience, housing, access to healthy food, walkable communities, open spaces, and accessible public transit in the LA region. 

#### Objectives
I am looking to completing a high-quality project with my peers that can be helpful to policymakers or decion makers in the LA region. Trhoughout the project, I hope to acquire and learn python coding skills , the basics of GIS, and learning how to visualize complex data. I hope to use these skills in a future professional setting.
